# ⛏️ strata
📦 `npm install @e280/strata`  
🫩 probably my tenth state management library, lol  

<br/>

### get in loser, we're managing state
🚦 **signals** — ephemeral view-level state  
🌳 **tree** — persistent app-level state  
🪄 **tracker** — reactivity integration hub  

<br/>

> [!TIP]  
> incredibly, signals and trees are interoperable.  
> that means, effects and computeds are responsive to changes in tree state.  

<br/>

## 🚦 signals — *ephemeral view-level state*
- `@e280/strata/signals`
  ```ts
  import {signal, effect, computed} from "@e280/strata"
  ```
- **signals are little bundles of joy**
  ```ts
  const count = signal(0)

  console.log(count.get())
    // 0

  count.set(1)

  console.log(count.value)
    // 1
  ```
  - components/views will auto rerender when relevant signals change  
    (if your component/view library is cool an integrates with `tracker`)
  - three ways to get it
    ```ts
    count() // 1
    count.get() // 1
    count.value // 1
    ```
  - three ways to set it
    ```ts
    await count(2)
    await count.set(2)
    count.value = 2
    ```
  - using `await` here allows you to wait for downstream effects to finish
- **effects are run when the relevant signals change**
  ```ts
  effect(() => console.log(count()))
    // 2

  count.value++
    // 3
  ```
- **computed signals are super lazy**
  ```ts
  const tenly = computed(() => {
    console.log("recomputed!")
    return count() * 10
  })

  console.log(tenly())
    // "recomputed!"
    // 30

  await count(4)

  console.log(tenly.value)
    // "recomputed!"
    // 40
  ```

<br/>

## 🌳 tree — *persistent app-level state*
- `@e280/strata/tree`
- single-source-of-truth state tree
- immutable except for `mutate(fn)` calls
- undo/redo history, cross-tab sync, localStorage persistence
- no spooky-dookie proxy magic — just god's honest javascript

#### `Trunk` is your app's state tree root
- better stick to json-friendly serializable data
  ```ts
  import {Trunk} from "@e280/strata"

  const trunk = new Trunk({
    count: 0,
    snacks: {
      peanuts: 8,
      bag: ["popcorn", "butter"],
    },
  })

  trunk.state.count // 0
  trunk.state.snacks.peanuts // 8
  ```

#### formal mutations to change state
- ⛔ informal mutations are denied
  ```ts
  trunk.state.count++ // error is thrown
  ```
- ✅ formal mutations are allowed
  ```ts
  await trunk.mutate(s => s.count++)
  ```

#### `Branch` is a view into a subtree
- it's a lens, make lots of them, pass 'em around your app
  ```ts
  const snacks = trunk.branch(s => s.snacks)
  ```
- run branch mutations
  ```ts
  await snacks.mutate(s => s.peanuts++)
  ```
- array mutations are unironically based, actually
  ```ts
  await snacks.mutate(s => s.bag.push("salt"))
  ```
- you can branch a branch

#### watch for mutations
- on the trunk, we can listen deeply for mutations within the whole tree
  ```ts
  trunk.watch(s => console.log(s.count))
  ```
- whereas branch listeners don't care about changes outside their scope
  ```ts
  snacks.watch(s => console.log(s.peanuts))
  ```
- watch returns a fn to stop listening
  ```ts
  const stop = trunk.watch(s => console.log(s.count))
  stop() // stop listening
  ```

### only discerning high-class aristocrats are permitted beyond this point

#### `Trunk.setup` for localStorage persistence etc
- simple setup
  ```ts
  const {trunk} = await Trunk.setup({
    version: 1, // 👈 bump whenever your change state schema!
    initialState: {count: 0},
  })
  ```
  - uses localStorage by default
- it's compatible with [`@e280/kv`](https://github.com/e280/kv)
  ```ts
  import {Kv, StorageDriver} from "@e280/kv"

  const kv = new Kv(new StorageDriver())
  const store = kv.store<any>("appState")

  const {trunk} = await Trunk.setup({
    version: 1,
    initialState: {count: 0},
    persistence: {
      store,
      onChange: StorageDriver.onStorageEvent,
    },
  })
  ```

#### `Chronobranch` for undo/redo history
- first, put a `Chronicle` into your state tree
  ```ts
  const trunk = new Trunk({
    count: 0,
    snacks: Trunk.chronicle({
      peanuts: 8,
      bag: ["popcorn", "butter"],
    }),
  })
  ```
  - *big-brain moment:* the whole chronicle *itself* is stored in the state.. serializable.. think persistence — user can close their project, reopen, and their undo/redo history is still chillin' — *brat girl summer*
- second, make a `Chronobranch` which is like a branch
  ```ts
  const snacks = trunk.chronobranch(64, s => s.snacks)
    //                               \
    //               how many past snapshots to store
  ```
- mutations will advance history (undoable/redoable)
  ```ts
  await snacks.mutate(s => s.peanuts = 101)

  await snacks.undo()
    // back to 8 peanuts

  await snacks.redo()
    // forward to 101 peanuts
  ```
- you can check how many undoable or redoable steps are available
  ```ts
  snacks.undoable // 2
  snacks.redoable // 1
  ```
- chronobranch can have its own branch — all their mutations advance history
- plz pinky-swear right now, that you won't create a chronobranch under a branch under another chronobranch 💀

## 🪄 tracker — integrations
- `@e280/strata/tracker`
- all reactivity is orchestrated by the `tracker`
- if you are integrating a new state object, or a new view layer that needs to react to state changes, just read [tracker.ts](./s/tracker/tracker.ts)

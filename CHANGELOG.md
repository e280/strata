- 🍏 update dependencies

### v0.2.2
- 🔶 branch `.on` is no longer a full stz `Sub`, but is now a simple subscriber fn
- 🔶 "sync coherence" rework tree behavior, mutations now take immediate effect -- but as a consequence, mutation loop detection is no longer provided -- you used to get an error if you trigger a mutation from an effect that was triggered by a mutation, but now, no error is thrown, you are on your own
- 🔶 deprecated name `Options` in favor of more specific `TreeOptions`
- 🍏 update dependencies

### v0.2.1
- 🍏 update dependencies

- 🍏 introduce and encourage new `$signal` naming convention in readme
- 🟥 signal rework. new implementation. mostly backwards-compatible.
  - 🟥 renamed type `Signaloid` to `SignalyFn`
  - 🟥 renamed type `Signal` to `SignalFn`
  - 🟥 renamed type `LazySignal` to `LazyFn`
  - 🟥 renamed type `DeriveSignal` to `DerivedFn`
  - 🟥 signal publish no longer takes a value (it publishes the sneak value)
  - 🟥 signal set now accepts second param forcePublish to enforce a publish during the set
  - 🍏 add type `Signaly` for (any signal-like core classes)
  - 🍏 add nice `.toString()` handlers, helpful for templating mistakes
  - 🍏 new primitive classes (without hipster syntax)
    - `new Signal(0)`
    - `new Lazy(formulaFn)`
    - `new Derived(formulaFn)`
    - these classes have a new `.fn()` method that returns a hipster fn
    - "porcelain" fns now return hipster-fn variants, `signal(0)`, `lazy(formulaFn)`, `derived(formulaFn)`
